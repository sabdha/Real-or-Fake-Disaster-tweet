You don't have to donwload the data such that you don't have to suffer from memory shortage of your local machine. \n\nYet sometimes especially when a competition is close to the end, kernel becomes unstable;(\n\nOne great solution to avoid your flustration is to use **google colab ** in the rainy day. Google colab allows you to perform data analysis almost like you do in Kaggle kernels: load data on cloud, perform EDA, train and test your models, and even submit to Kaggle!\n\nIn this kernel, I show you how to do it in your google colab.
